# K-Means-Clustering
Implementing K-means clustering using python (for practice purposes).

# Instructions
Consider the data set provided and use for the below questions

1. Visualize the data using a scatter plot.  From the plot determine an appropriate value of k.

2. Create multiple kMeans models from sklearn library using the values of k from 1 to 10

3. Calculate the within sum of squares for each value of k

4. Use the value in 3 above to determine the most suitable value for k using the elbow method

5. Use the k above to create a final kMeans model using the sklearn library

6. Visualize the clusters from 5 above using a scatter plot. Ensure to show the clusters, their centroids and assignment of each point to a cluster.
